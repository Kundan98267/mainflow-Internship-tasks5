MainFlow Task 5 - Classification Analysis (Pass/Fail Prediction & Sentiment Analysis)
This repository contains Task 5 of the Data Science Internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

📊 Project Overview
The goal of this task is to perform Classification Analysis using Logistic Regression on two different datasets:

📚 Student Pass/Fail Prediction based on study hours and attendance.

💬 Sentiment Analysis on customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The task involves model building, data preprocessing, text vectorization (TF-IDF), model training, evaluation, and visualization.

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

spaCy

Regular Expressions

TF-IDF Vectorizer

📈 Key Features
